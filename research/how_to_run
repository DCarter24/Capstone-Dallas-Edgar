go to the ros workspace
"source install/setup.bash"
  ros2 launch rplidar_ros launch_steer.py
  ###DEBUGGING TIPS###
  The python files that are ran when running lunch_steer are in scripts directory.
  lidar_object_detection and steering_control
###Open up CMAKELists.txt file
#  This is what was added:
" #Install the Python scripts
install(PROGRAMS
  scripts/steering_control.py
  scripts/lidar_object_detection.py
  DESTINATION lib/${PROJECT_NAME}
)

# Install the launch file for steering control
install(
  DIRECTORY launch
  DESTINATION share/${PROJECT_NAME}/launch #not sure if "/launch" would be a problem
  #if pasted here
)"
  ###SCRIPTS FOLDER###
I added the files to the scripts folder and ran
chmod +x steering_control.py
chmod +x lidar_object_detection.py # in the scripts directory to make sure they're executable.

  ### setup.py file###
  ##I created this file, if you receive an error about multiple launch files, this may be the spot to debug.
  added these as the entry points:
entry_points={
    'console_scripts': [
        'steering_control = scripts.steering_control:main',
        'lidar_object_detection = scripts.lidar_object_detection:main',
    ],
},

  ### PACKAGE.XML FILE###
#didn't add these  rclcpp
  rosconsole
  sensor_msgs
  std_srvs
  rclcpp_components
